My first steps with github

Hi! I'm Philipp

After taking the GitHub introduction guide I want to create my own mobile apps and websites, first and foremost due to personal interest.
I'm already excited about learning new stuff in the IT world to understand what will influence the world around me in the future.

Projects I already have in mind:

>(As of 10.03.2017)
> - Create new website for girlfriend's family apartment 
> - Photography app to determine the "golden hour" based on location +lunar calendar +text-based weather forecast
> - Macro nutrition calculator +Carb Cycling calculator


Happy coding.
